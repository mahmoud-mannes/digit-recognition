# digit-recognition
A machine learning model built from scratch on python using only Object Oriented Programming without the use of external libraries (except for idx2numpy and numpy for data handling and training). Built to recognize digits from a 28px by 28px image of handwritten numbers. 
Data used: MNIST dataset containing both handwritten images and labels of numbers.
Currently a work in progress.
